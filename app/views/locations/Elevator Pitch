Non-Tech
I am a software developer that builds fully functional web applications. With knowledge of backend and frontend web technologies in ruby on rails I've contributed to multiple teams that delivered full scale web applications in addition to the multiple personal web applications I have created. I am looking for opportunities in Boston for jr developer and database positions.
